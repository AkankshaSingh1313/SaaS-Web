<h3>SAAS</h3>

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model in which software applications are hosted by a third-party provider and made available to customers over the internet. Instead of purchasing and installing software on individual computers or servers, users can access the application via a web browser or API (Application Programming Interface) from any device with an internet connection.
